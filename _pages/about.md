I'm a theoretical physicist with broad interests in <em>gravity</em>, <em>cosmology</em>, and <em>high-energy physics</em>, currently working as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at University College London (UCL). My research looks at novel ways of probing the fundamental laws of Nature, whether by using <em>gravitational waves</em> as powerful new astronomical messengers, or by using cutting-edge <em>quantum technologies</em> to simulate the early Universe.

I am currently working on <em>false vacuum decay</em>, a fascinating quantum-mechanical phenomenon that is a ubiquitous feature of early-Universe cosmology. As a member of the [Quantum Simulators for Fundamental Physics (QSimFP) Consortium](https://qsimfp.org/), I am helping to develop laboratory experiments that will empirically test our understanding of vacuum decay for the first time. These experiments could have important and far-reaching implications for areas ranging from inflation and the multiverse to the stability of the Higgs field.

Another key focus of my research is <em>gravitational-wave astronomy</em>. I am particularly interested in using gravitational-wave observations to probe cosmology and fundamental physics, for example by searching for exotic sources like cosmic strings and primordial black holes, or by using gravitational-wave sources as [tracers of cosmic structure formation](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2127416). I was recently awarded a [Buchalter Cosmology Prize](http://www.buchaltercosmologyprize.org/) (2nd prize) for my work on detecting gravitational waves via [their effect on binary systems](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.101103).

I did my PhD in Theoretical Physics at King's College London (2017-2021), under the supervision of Prof Mairi Sakellariadou. Before that, I did my BA and MSci in Astrophysics at the University of Cambridge (2013-2017).
