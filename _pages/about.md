I'm a theoretical physicist, working at the interface between <em>cosmology</em>, <em>astrophysics</em>, <em>high-energy physics</em>, and <em>quantum matter</em>. My research looks at new ways of probing the fundamental laws of Nature, whether by using <em>gravitational waves</em> as powerful new astronomical messengers, or by using cutting-edge <em>quantum technologies</em> to simulate the early Universe.

<p>
I'm currently based at the University of Cambridge, where I hold the Gavin Boyle Fellowship in Cosmology at the <a href="https://www.kicc.cam.ac.uk/">Kavli Institute for Cosmology</a> (KICC) and the <a href="https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/">Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics</a> (DAMTP).
I have also recently been awarded a UKRI Stephen Hawking Fellowship.
I am a Fellow of <a href="https://www.sel.cam.ac.uk/">Selwyn College</a>.

Much of my current work focuses on <em>vacuum decay</em>, a fascinating quantum-mechanical phenomenon that is a ubiquitous feature of early-Universe cosmology. As a member of the <a href="https://qsimfp.org/">Quantum Simulators for Fundamental Physics (QSimFP) Consortium</a>, I am helping to develop laboratory experiments that will <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.023506">empirically test our understanding of vacuum decay</a> for the first time. These experiments could have important and far-reaching implications for areas ranging from inflation and the multiverse to the stability of the Higgs field.
</p>

<p>
Another key focus of my research is <em>gravitational-wave astronomy</em>. I am particularly interested in using gravitational-wave observations to probe cosmology and fundamental physics, for example by searching for signals generated in the very early Universe, or by using gravitational-wave sources as <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/2127416">tracers of cosmic structure formation</a>. In 2023 I was awarded a <a href="http://www.buchaltercosmologyprize.org/">Buchalter Cosmology Prize</a> (2nd prize) for my work on detecting gravitational waves via <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.101103">their effect on binary systems</a>.

I was previously a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cosmoparticle">Cosmoparticle Initiative</a> at University College London (2021-2024). I did my PhD in Theoretical Physics at King's College London (2017-2021), and my MA and MSci in Astrophysics in Cambridge (2013-2017).
